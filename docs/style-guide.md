# Intro
This is a (flexible) set of coding rules that will guide us through this project. The goal is to make it easier to read our code and to create a universal, easy-to-understand stying ruleset for the project. Please abide by the rules. It will (I cannot emphasise this enough) make reading the code and life easier for anyone unfortunate enough to try to debug the code.

### TYPOGRAPHY
The default font size for this website is `10px = 1em`.
The `em` unit will be used for this project.

>We are using a `black` and `white` colour scheme because we haven't found a suitable colour scheme for this project. The main priority, for now, is to code out the layout for the website. The colour choice can be decided later, so we can save time.

### Media query
For easier readability, all media queries should be at the bottom of the style sheet. Putting it in between lines of code is just plain satanic behaviour.
